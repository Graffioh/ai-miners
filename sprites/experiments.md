# Experiments

## Accuracy (validation)

### FCN

- FCN: 
- FCN with Batch Norm (dropout 0.3): 
- FCN with Batch Norm (dropout 0.5): 

### CNN

- Normal: 
- with Batch Norm everywhere (dropout 0.5): 27%
- with Batch Norm everywhere (dropout 0.3): 
- with Batch Norm not in the FCN classification part: 
- less aggressive polling: 
- without polling: 

## Logging

*for detailed logs go into sprites/runs folder after training and running the model*

## TODO

- cross validation <-
- mini batch stratified sampling
